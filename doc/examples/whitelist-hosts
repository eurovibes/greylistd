### FILE:	/etc/greylistd/whitelist-hosts
### PURPOSE:	List of hosts from which we do not want to greylist mail
########################################################################
### 
### This file is not actually read by greylistd, but is normally referenced
### from the Mail Transport Agent (MTA) that invokes greylistd.  As such,
### the format of the entries is MTA-dependent.
### 
### Most MTAs support at least the following:
###  - A single IPv4 address, consisting of 4 octets (0-255):  192.168.0.1
###  - Between one and three octets, indicating an IPv4 network:  192.168.0
###  - A single host name:  gluck.debian.org
###  - Wildcards in a host name:  *.debian.org
###
### Exim 4 supports much more elaborate syntax, including regular expressions
### starting with "^" (e.g.: ^..crm[hx]c..\.comcast\.net), IP addresses with
### netmasks (10.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0), etc.  For full detail, refer to
### section 10.8 in the Exim 4 "spec.txt" file.
###
### !!! IMPORTANT !!!
### If you use host names in this list, beware that lookup failures will
### cause your MTA to temporarily reject the mail - indefinitely.  For that
### reason, it is generally better to use IP addresses than host names.
