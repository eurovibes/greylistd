greylistd (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed value of "false" from -1 to 1 in 'config' DebConf module.
    per report from Laurent Fousse <laurent@komite.net>.  This is required
    for POSIX compliance, and "ash"/"dash".  Closes: #296266.
  * Added 'except SystemExit' statement in main loop to avoid a
    "Fatal Event" message on exit.  Closes: #295898.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Mon, 14 Mar 2005 14:54:44 -0800

greylistd (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added French translation by Jean-Luc Coulon.  Closes: #292881.
  * The exception clause that is invoked when socket cannot be created
    referred to an old/undefined variable, thus causing a secondary
    exception and a misleading error message.  Fixed.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Sun,  6 Feb 2005 05:19:23 -0800

greylistd (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had exprimented with python-based config/postinst, and inadvertently
    made "python" a pre-dependency.  Reverted back to a regular dependency.
  * Updated to standards-version 3.6.1
  * Added support for "po-debconf" (DebConf >= 4.1.16, "po/", ..)
  * Updated "templates" to remove a non-essential question, as well as
    references to widget labels ("Yes"/"No"), to the computer/program as
    the first person ("I can do this for you..").  Closes: #290867.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Mon, 17 Jan 2005 16:11:45 -0800

greylistd (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified templates, config, postinst, postrm scripts to add new
    "greylist" user and group for the greylistd process, rather than
    using the ownership of the MTA process.  (The MTA user should be part of
    the "greylist" group).
  * Security fix: Set permission bits to 0600 when saving files, to prevent
    unauthorized users from peeking at greylist data.  (All access should go
    via /var/run/greylistd/socket).
  * Fixed exception logging; was indented wrongly, thus repeated
    the error message several times in the log.
  * Handle stdout "broken pipe" exception in "greylist" client program
    (common when piping output through a pager like "most").
  * Updated "greylistd-setup-exim4" to use try/except for runtime errors
    rather than doing a lot of "if" statements.
  * Beautified the "greylistd-setup-exim4" script and manual page a bit.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed,  5 Jan 2005 23:33:03 -0800

greylistd (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * greylistd-update-exim4 is no longer invoked via DebConf - modifying
    conffiles (especially from another package) violates Debian Policy.
    Instead, a note about its availabilty is presented, putting the burden
    of actually running it on the local administrator.
  * Removed /etc/default/greylist; the UGID setting is now written to
    /etc/init.d/greylist (not a conffile) by DebConf.
  * /etc/greylistd/config is no longer configured via DebConf; it remains
    a conffile.
  * Made package description more novice-friendly.  Closes: #287486.
  * Internal type-aware function to parse configuration/data files, rather
    than ConfigParser(), in order to save on memory during load/save ops.
  * Better handling of exceptions - unexpected runtime exceptions are
    logged (via syslog() or stderr).

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed, 29 Dec 2004 09:48:29 -0800

greylistd (0.6.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another critical, dumb bug: Would crash on first save if "triplets"
    file does not already exist.  Closes: #286364.
  * Program would exit with socket error ('broken pipe') if the client
    connected before receiving reply.
  * Program died quietly on errors, because I had omitted a "raise" 
    after cleanup in the exception handler.  Fixed.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Tue, 21 Dec 2004 00:14:43 -0800

greylistd (0.6.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed critical bug: "lastsave" timestamp was not updated after save
    to disk, so the main loop tried to save continuously, and consumed
    all available disk/cpu bandwidth.  Fixed.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Sat, 18 Dec 2004 23:49:25 -0800

greylistd (0.6.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some spelling errors and unclear text in DebConf templates,
    control file, and manual pages.
  * "greylistd-setup-exim4" no longer prints error if "-no-fail" is given.
    (We don't care to see "Not configured" or "Not found" messages for each
    Exim 4 configuration file when we remove existing configuration prior to
    installing new one).
  * Option parsing in "greylistd-setup-exim4" is generalized/simplified.
  * "greylist" client crashed if an empty response was received from the
    daemon.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed, 15 Dec 2004 17:03:40 -0800

greylistd (0.6.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem with statistics counter; would overcount the
    number of items that entered each list (white, grey).
  * Fixed unlimited growth of items in 'newTriplets' list in the case
    where these were not periodically flushed to file (i.e. when 
    'savetriplets = false')
  * Changed package description to reflect some more detail of how
    greylistd interacts with MTA. Closes: #285346.
  * Removed path names from the command synopsis line in the 
    greylist(1) and greylistd(8) manual pages. Closes: #267225.
  * Format "list" output to include date of last hit and number of hits
    for each data set.  Closes: #268059.
  * Greylist data is saved to temporary file, then renamed.
    This prevents a race condition where all data can be lost in case
    of a power failure or a full filesystem.  Closes: #285343.
    (Data is saved periodically as of version 0.6).
  * Restructured runCommand() routine - it no longer walks through
    a large "if ... elif ... elif ... else" block, but tries to invoke
    a "do_<command>" function according to the command specified.
  * Arguments to actions must now be prefixed with (any number of) hyphens.
    For instance, "greylist add --white", not "greylist add white".
  * Added "--white", "--grey", and "--black" options to the "check" and
    "update" commands; if specified, greylistd returns a boolean value
    rather than a list name.  So "greylist --grey <data>" would show
    whether <data> is currently in a "grey" state.

greylistd (0.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dumb int/string bug just introduced - prevented triplet
    data from being loaded and crashed greylistd.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Tue, 14 Dec 2004 19:03:35 -0800

greylistd (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminated some bashisms in maintainer scripts (per lintian).

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Tue, 14 Dec 2004 15:30:32 -0800

greylistd (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now uses DebConf for initial setup and configuration.
  * New utility "greylistd-setup-exim4" adds/removes support for greylistd
    in Exim 4 configuration files; optionally invoked via DebConf.
  * Tries to detect ownership of MTA process, and set greylistd ownership
    accordingly, to circumvent problems with users who cannot read.
    Closes: #267075.
  * 'whitelist-hosts' moved from /etc/mail to /etc/greylistd. Closes: #267221.
  * 'whitelist-hosts' contains some text explaining syntax. Closes: #267314.
  * 'whitelist-hosts' contains warning about lookup failures. Closes: #270814.
  * Default/documented Exim 4 examples do not greylist authenticated clients.
    Closes: #272572.
  * Depend on Python version 2.3 or newer; also, program checks that we
    are running a supported version.  Closes: #267296.
  * Greylist data is now saved at regular intervals, as specified
    in the configuration file (default is 300 seconds).  File saves can
    also be triggerd with the "save" command.  Closes: #267316.
  * The original (unhashed) greylist data is now retained in a
    separate file; a "list" command gives access to it.
  * Clean up (remove UNIX domain socket....) after exceptions.
  * Init script supports 'reload' (saves greylist triplets).
  * "restart" command in init script sleeps for one second after killing
    old process, before starting new one.  Closes: #273089.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Tue, 14 Dec 2004 12:35:49 -0800

greylistd (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Socket 'mode' setting in config file should be in [socket]
    section, not in [data] section.  Closes: #261331.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Sun, 25 Jul 2004 18:52:59 -0700

greylistd (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed '-N' suffix in version number, as this is currently a
    native Debian package. Closes: #261097.
  * Removed debian/greylistd, left over from prior "debmake".
    Closes: #261094.
  * Added copyright information in source files; fixed "copyright" 
    file.  Closes: #261092.
  * Added postrm script to remove greylist data. Closes: #261099.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Fri, 23 Jul 2004 11:05:44 -0700

greylistd (0.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added 'doc/examples/30_exim4-config_check_rcpt', containing the 
    stock "acl_check_rcpt" from the exim4-config package, but with
    the 'greylistd' stuff included.   

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed, 30 Jun 2004 10:09:17 -0700

greylistd (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Inserting the snippet from 'exim4-acl-example.txt' into
    a default Debian Exim 4 configuration would cause the server
    to become an open relay (in case of a NULL envelope sender).
    Added "domains = +local_domains ..." condition to prevent this.
    Closes: #254633.
  * Redid debian/ directory to use 'debhelper' instead of 'debmake'.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Tue, 29 Jun 2004 01:22:28 -0700

greylistd (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added configuration file /etc/default/greylistd, to allow
    'greylistd' to run under a custom UID/GID (such as
    Debian-exim:Debian-exim) rather than the default 'mail:mail'.
    Also modified "init" script accordingly.
  * Documented the above in README.debian.  Closes: #253764.
  * greylistd.8, exim4-acl-example.txt: Added a warning about what
    happens when 'greylistd' is not running (all deliveries are
    subject to a temporary failure); along with a suggested
    workaround.  Closes: #253872.
  * Removed (normally ineffective) owner settings from
    '/etc/greylistd/config', and from "greylistd" code.
  * Added IP subnet example to whitelist-hosts.  Closes: #253762.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Mon, 14 Jun 2004 13:29:18 -0700

greylistd (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Statistics reporting was broken - first/last timestamps were reversed.
    Also beautified report output a little bit.
  * Removed reference to "as of version 0.1" in greylistd(8) man page.
  * Updated README.debian with a sentence about Exim and socket permissions.
  * Updated Exim4 configuration example to remove semi-redundant condition.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed,  9 Jun 2004 11:38:34 -0700

greylistd (0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up Debian 'conffiles' & other stuff based on lintian report.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Tue,  1 Jun 2004 10:33:17 -0700

greylistd (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'greylist' did not run; "ConfigParser" was not imported. DOH!
  * Added support for blacklists; entries have to be manually entered.
  * Added collection of hit statistics, and a 'stats' operation
  * Added a 'clear' operation to remove all data and statistics
  * Updated Exim4 configuration example to add a list of whitelisted
    hosts that would not be subject to greylisting.  Also modified
    the data triplet that is passed to greylistd, so that it always
    includes the IP address, rather than the rDNS name, of the sending
    host.
  * Added a new file: examples/whitelist-hosts
  * Updated manual pages.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Fri, 28 May 2004 12:49:36 -0700

greylistd (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * greylistd can now handle more than one connection at a time.
  * greylistd handles a -HUP signal and other exceptions more gracefully.
  * Corrected the error message "Unknown command" in 'greylist' to
    "Unknown action", as printed in the help output.
  * The path of the configuration file is now /etc/default/greylistd.
    It contains two new sections: [socket] and [data], listing the 
    file path of the UNIX domain socket and the data hash file,
    respectively.
  * The default filemode of the socket is now 0660; this can be
    modified in the configuration file.
  * In the source archive, manual pages have been moved out from the
    "debian/" subdirectory into "doc/", as these are not Debian-specific.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed, 26 May 2004 14:38:00 -0700

greylistd (0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.

 -- Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>  Wed, 19 May 2004 16:38:52 -0700
